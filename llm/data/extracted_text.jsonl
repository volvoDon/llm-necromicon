{"2": "The Complete Simon\nNecronomicon\nINTRODUCTION\nIN THE MID - 1920's, roughly two blocks from where the Warlock Shop once stood, in\nBrooklyn Heights, lived a quiet, reclusive man, an author of short stories, who eventually\ndivorced his wife of two years and returned to his boyhood home in Rhode Island, where\nhe lived with his two aunts. Born on August 20, 1890, Howard Phillips Lovecraft would\ncome to exert an impact on the literary world that dwarfs his initial successes with Weird\nTales magazine in 1923. He died, tragically, at the age of 46 on March 15, 1937, a victim\nof cancer of the intestine and Bright's Disease. Though persons of such renown as\nDashiell Hammett were to become involved in his work, anthologising it for publication\nboth here an abroad, the reputation of a man generally conceded to be the \"Father of\nGothic Horror\" did not really come into its own until the past few years, with the massive\nre-publication of his works by various houses, a volume of his selected letters, and his\nbiography. In the July, 1975, issue The Atlantic Monthly, there appeared a story entitled\n\"There Are More Things\", written by Jorge Luis Borges, \"To the memory of H.P.\nLovecraft\". This gesture by a man of the literary stature of Borges is certainly an"}
{"3": "for weeks and months to come: satanic rituals, black masses, animal sacrifice, and even\nhuman sacrifice, were reported - or blatantly lied about. For although many of the stories\nwere simply not true or fanciful exaggeration, one thing was certain: Aleister Crowley\nwas a Magician, and one of the First Order.\nBorn on October 12, 1875, in England - in the same country as Shakespeare - Edward\nAlexander Crowley grew up in a strict Fundamentalist religious family, members of a\nsect called the \"Plymouth Brethren\". The first person to call him by that Name and\nNumber by which he would become famous (after the reference in the Book of\nRevelation), \"The Beast 666\", was his mother, and he eventually took this appellation to\nheart. He changed his name to Aleister Crowley while still at Cambridge, and by that\nname , plus \"666\", he would never be long out of print, or out of newspapers. For he\nbelieved himself to be the incarnation of a god, an Ancient One, the vehicle of a New\nAge of Man's history, the Aeon of Horus, displacing the old Age of Osiris. In 1904, he\nhad received a message, from what Lovecraft might have called \"out of space\", that\ncontained the formula for a New World Order, a new system of philosophy, science, art\nand religion, but this New Order had to begin with the fundamental part, and common\ndenominator, of all four: Magick.\nIn 1937, the year Lovecraft dies, the Nazis banned the occult lodges of Germany, notable\namong them two organisations which Crowley had supervised: the A\\ A\\ and the O.T.O.,\nthe latter of which he was elected head in England, and the former which he founded\nhimself. There are those who believe that Crowley was somehow, magickally,\nresponsible for the Third Reich, for two reasons: one, that the emergence of New World\nOrders generally seems to instigate holocausts and, two, that he is said to have influenced\nthe mind of Adolf Hitler. While it is almost certain that Crowley and Hitler never met, it\nis known that Hitler belonged to several occult lodges in the early days after the First\nWar; the symbol of one of these, the Thule Gesellschaft which preached a doctrine of\nAryan racial superiority, was the infamous Swastika which Hitler was later to adopt as\nthe Symbol of the forms, however, is evident in many of his writings, notably the essays\nwritten in the late 'Thirties. Crowley seemed to regard the Nazi phenomenon as a\nCreature of Christianity, in it's anti-Semitism and sever moral restrictions concerning its\nadherents, which lead to various types of lunacies and \"hangups\" that characterised many\nof the Reich's leadership. Yet, there can be perhaps little doubt that the chaos which"}
{"4": "higher Self, via a process of individuation that is active and dynamic (being brought\nabout by the \"patient\" himself) as opposed to the passive depth analysis of the Jungian\nadepts, Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos was meant for entertainment. Scholars, of course, are\nable to find higher, ulterior motives in Lovecraft's writings, as can be done with any\nmanifestation of Art.\nLovecraft depicted a kind of Christian Myth of the struggle between opposing forces of\nLight and Darkness, between God and Satan, in the Cthulhu Mythos. Some critics may\ncomplain that this smacks more of the Manichaen heresy than it does of genuine\nChristian dogma; yet, as a priest and former monk, I believe it is fair to say that this\ndogma is unfortunately very far removed from the majority of the Faithful to be of much\nconsequence. The idea of a War against Satan, and of the entities of Good and Evil\nhaving roughly equivalent Powers, is perhaps best illustrated by the belief, common\namong the Orthodox churches of the East, in a personal devil as well as a personal angel.\nThis concept has been amplified by the Roman Catholic Church to such an extent -\nperhaps subconsciously - that a missal in the Editor's possession contains an engraving\nfor the Feast of St. Andrew, Apostle, for November 30, that bears the legend \"Ecce Qui\nTollis Peccata Mundi\" - Behold Him Who Taketh Away The Sins of the World - and the\npicture above it is of the atomic bomb!\nBasically, there are two \"sets\" of gods in the mythos : the Elder Gods, about whom not\nmuch is revealed, save that they are a stellar Race that occasionally comes to the rescue\nof man, and which corresponds to the Christian \"Light\"; and the Ancient Ones, about\nwhich much is told, sometimes in great detail, who correspond to \"Darkness\". These\nlatter are the Evil Gods who wish nothing but ill for the Race of Man, and who constantly\nstrive to break into our world through a Gate or Door that leads from the Outside, In.\nThere are certain people, among us, who are devotees of the Ancient Ones, and who try\nto open the Gate, so that this evidently repulsive organisation may once again rule the\nEarth. Chief among these is Cthulhu, typified as a Sea Monster, dwelling in the Great\nDeep, a sort of primeval Ocean; a Being that Lovecraft collaborator August Derleth\nwrongly calls a \"water elemental\". There is also Azazoth, the blind idiot god of Chaos,\nYog Sothot, Azathoth's partner in Chaos, Shub Niggurath, the \"goat with a thousand\nyoung\", and others. They appear at various times throughout the stories of the Cthulhu\nMythos in frightening forms, which test the strength and resourcefulness of the"}

Idries Shah tells us of a search he\nconducted for a copy of the Book of Power by the Arab magician Abdul-Kadir (see: The\nSecret Lore of Magic by Shah), of which only one copy was ever found. The Keys of\nSolomon had a similar reputation, as did The Magus by Barret, until all of these works\nwere eventually reprinted in the last fifteen years or so. The Golden Dawn, a famous\nBritish and American Occult lodge of the turn of the Century, was said to have possessed\na manuscript called \"the Veils of Negative Existence\" by another Arab.\nThese were the sorcerer's handbooks, and generally not meant as textbooks or\nencyclopedias of ceremonial magick. In other words, the sorcerer or magician is\nsupposed to be in possession of the requisite knowledge and training with which to carry\nout a complex magickal ritual, just as a cook is expected to be able to master the\nscrambling of eggs before he conjures an \"eggs Benedict\"; the grimoires, or Black Books,\nwere simply variations on a theme, like cookbooks, different records of what previous\nmagicians had done, the spirits they had contacted, and the successes they had. The\nmagicians who now read these works are expected to be able to select the wheat from the\nchaff, in much the same fashion as an alchemist discerning the deliberate errors in a\ntreatise on his subject.\nTherefore it was (and is) insanity for the tyro to pick up a work on ceremonial Magick\nlike the Lesser Key of Solomon to practise conjurations. It would also be folly to pick up\nCrowley's Magick in Theory and Practise with the same intention. Both books are\ndefinitely not for beginners, a point which cannot be made too often. Unfortunately,\nperhaps, the dread NECRONOMICON falls into this category.\nCrowley's Magick was a testimony of what he has found in his researches into the\nforbidden, and forgotten, lore of past civilisations and ancient times. His Book of the Law\nwas written in Cairo in the Spring of 1904, when he believed himself to be in contact\nwith a praeter-human intelligence called Aiwass who dictated to him the Three Chapters\nthat make up the Book. It had influenced him more than any other, and the remainder of"}

Demons, vampires, psychic leeches, ghastly forms accost the aspiring\nmagician from every angle, from every quarter around the circumference of the magick\ncircle, and they must be destroyed lest they devour the magician himself. When Crowley\nprofessed to have passed the obstacles, and crossed the Abyss of Knowledge, and found\nhis true Self, he found it was identical with the Beast of the Book of Revelation, 666,\nwhom Christianity considers to represent the Devil. Indeed, Crowley had nothing but\nadmiration for the Shaitan (Satan) of the so-called \"devil-worshipping\" cult of the\nYezidis of Mesopotamia, knowledge of which led him to declare the lines that open this\nIntroduction. For he saw that the Yezidis possess a Great Secret and a Great Tradition\nthat extends far back into time, beyond the origin of the Sun cults of Osiris, Mithra and\nChrist; even before the formation of the Judaic religion, and the Hebrew tongue. Crowley\nharkened back to a time before the Moon was worshipped, to the \"Shadow Out of Time\";\nand in this, whether he realised it as such or not, he had heard the \"Call of Cthulhu\".\nSumeria\nThat a reclusive author of short stories who lived in a quiet neighbourhood in New\nEngland, and the manic, infamous Master Magician who called the world his home,\nshould have somehow met in the sandy wastes of some forgotten civilisation seems\nincredible.

They had a list of their kings before the Flood, which\neven they carefully chronicled, as did many another ancient civilisation around the world.\nIt is believed that they had a sophisticated system of astronomy (and astrology) as well as\nan equally religious rituale. Magick, as well in history, begins at Sumer for the Western\nWorld, for it his here, in the sand-buried cuneiform tablets that recorded an Age, that the\nfirst Creation Epic is found, the first exorcism, the first ritual invocations of planetary\ndeities, the first dark summonings of evil Powers, and ironically, the first \"burnings\" of\npeople the anthropologists call \"Witches\".\nLovecraft's mythos deals with what are known chthonic deities, that is, underworld gods\nand goddesses, much like the Leviathan of the Old Testament. The pronunciation of\nchthonic is 'katonic', which explains Lovecraft's famous Miskatonic River and\nMiskatonic University, not to mention the chief deity of his pantheon, Cthulhu, a sea\nmonster who lies, \"not dead, but dreaming\" below the world; an Ancient One and\nsupposed enemy of Mankind and the intelligent Race. Cthulhu is accompanied by an\nassortment of other grotesqueries, such as Azathot and Shub Niggurath. It is of extreme\nimportance to occult scholars that many of these deities had actual counterparts, at least\nin name, to deities of the Sumerian Tradition, that same Tradition that the Magus Aleister\nCrowley deemed it so necessary to \"rediscover\".\nThe Underworld in ancient Sumer was known by many names, among them ABSU or\n\"Abyss\", sometimes as Nar Mattaru, the great Underworld Ocean, and also as Cutha or\nKUTU as it is called in the Enuma Elish (the Creation Epic of the Sumerians). The\nphonetic similarity between Cutha and KUTU and Chthonic, as well as Cthulhu, is\nstriking. Judging by a Sumerian grammar at hand, the word KUTULU or Cuthalu\n(Lovecraft's's Cthulhu Sumerianised) would mean \"The Man of KUTU (Cutha); the Man\nof the Underworld; Satan or Shaitan, as he is known to the Yezidis (whom Crowley\nconsidered to be the remnants of the Sumerian Tradition).

AZAG in Sumerian means \"Enchanter\" or \"Magician\"; THOTH in\nCoptic is the name given to the Egyptian God of Magick and Wisdom, TAHUTI, who\nwas evoked by both the Golden Dawn and by Crowley himself (and known to the Greeks\nas Hermes, from whence we get \"Hermetic\"). AZAG-THOTH is, therefore, a Lord of\nMagicians, but of the \"Black\" magicians, or the sorcerers of the \"Other Side\".\nThere is a seeming reference to SHUB NIGGURATH in the NECRONOMICON, in the\nname of a Sumerian deity, the \"Answerer of Prayers\", called ISHNIGARRAB. The word\n\"Shub\" is to be found in the Sumerian language in reference to the Rite of Exorcism, one\nof which is called Nam Shub and means \"the Throwing\". It is, however, as yet unclear as\nto what the combination SHUB ISHNIGARRAB (SHUB NIGGURATH) might actually\nmean.\nThere was a battle between the forces of \"light\" and \"darkness\" (so-called) that took place\nlong before man was created, before even the cosmos as we know it existed. It is\ndescribed fully in the Enuma Elish and in the bastardised version found in the\nNECRONOMICON, and involved the Ancient Ones, led by the Serpent MUMMU-\nTIAMAT and her male counterpart ABSU, against the ELDER GODS (called such in the\nN.) led by the Warrior MARDUK, son of the Sea God ENKI, Lord of Magicians of this\nSide, or what could be called \"White Magicians\" - although close examination of the\nmyths of ancient times makes one pause before attempting to judge which of the two\nwarring factions was \"good\" or \"evil\". MARDUK won this battle - in much the same way\nthat later St. George and St. Michael would defeat the Serpent again - the cosmos was\ncreated from the body of the slain Serpent, and man was created from the blood of the\nslain commander of the Ancient Army, KINGU, thereby making man a descendent of the\nBlood of the Enemy, as well as the \"breath\" of the Elder Gods; a close parallel to the\n\"sons of God and daughters of men\" reference in the Old Testament. Yet, though the\nidentity of the Victor is clear, there were - and are - certain persons and organisations that\ndared side with the vanquished, believing the Ancient Ones to be a source of tremendous,\nand most unbelievable, power.\nWorship of the Ancient Ones in History"}

In China, however, there\nis an interesting twist. Far from being considered a completely hostile creature, dedicated\nto the erasure of mankind from the page of existence, the Dragon is given a place of pre-\neminence and one does not hear of a Chinese angel or saint striving to slay the dragon,\nbut rather to cultivate it. The Chinese system of geomancy, feng shui (pronounced fung\nshway) is the science of understanding the \"dragon currents\" which exist beneath the\nearth, these same telluric energies that are distilled in such places as Chartres Cathedral in\nFrance, Glastonbury Tor in England, and the Ziggurats of Mesopotamia. In both the\nEuropean and Chinese cultures, the Dragon or Serpent is said to reside somewhere\n\"below the earth\"; it is a powerful force, a magickal force, which is identified with\nmastery over the created world; it is also a power that can be summoned by the few and\nnot the many. However, in China, there did not seem to be a backlash of fear or\nresentment against this force as was known in Europe and Palestine, and the symbol of\nmight and kingship in China is still the Dragon. In the West, the conjuration, cultivation,\nor worship of this Power was strenuously opposes with the advent of the Solar,\nMonotheistic religions and those who clung to the Old Ways were effectively\nextinguished. The wholesale slaughter of those called \"Witches\" during the Inquisition is\nan example of this, as well as the solemn and twisted - that is to say, purposeless and\nunenlightened - celibacy that the Church espoused. For the orgone of Wilhelm Reich is\njust as much Leviathan as the Kundalini of Tantrick adepts, and the Power raised by the\nWitches. It has always, at least in the past two thousand years, been associated with\noccultism and essentially with Rites of Evil Magick, or the Forbidden Magick, of the\nEnemy, and of Satan . . .\n. . . and the twisting, sacred Spiral formed by the Serpent of the Caduceus, and by the\nspinning of the galaxies, is also the same Leviathan as the Spiral of the biologists' Code\nof Life : DNA"}

The Goddess has also been worshipped all over the\nworld, and under many names, but is still essentially the same Goddess. That TIAMAT\nwas undoubtedly female is to the point; and that the Chinese as well as the Sumerians\nperceived of two dragon currents, male and female, gives the researchers a more complex\npicture. The Green Dragon and the Red Dragon of the alchemists are thus identified, as\nthe positive and negative energies that compromise the cosmos of our perception, as\nmanifest in the famous Chinese yin-yang symbol.\nBut what of INANNA, the single planetary deity having a female manifestation among\nthe Sumerians? She is invoked in the NECRONOMICON and identified as the\nvanquisher of Death, for she descended into the Underworld and defeated her sister, the\nGoddess of the Abyss, Queen ERESHKIGAL (possibly another name for TIAMAT).\nInterestingly enough, the myth has many parallels with the Christian concept of Christ's\ndeath and resurrection, among which the Crucifixion (INANNA was impaled on a stake\nas a corpse), the three days in the Sumerian Hades, and the eventual Resurrection are\noutstanding examples of how Sumerian mythology previewed the Christian religion by\nperhaps as many as three thousand years - a fact that beautifully illustrates the cosmic and\neternal nature of this myth.\nTherefore, the Goddess of the Witches has two distinct forms: the Ancient One, Goddess\nof the Dragon-like telluric Power which is raised in Magickal rituals, and the Elder\nGoddess, Defeater of Death, who brings the promise of Resurrection and Rejuvenation to\nher followers those who must reside for a time after death and between incarnations in\nwhat is called the \"Summerland\".\nSumer-land?\nAnother hallmark of the Craft of the Wise is evident within the NECRONOMICON, as\nwell as in general Sumerian literature, and that is the arrangement of the cross-quarter"}

The Moon was governed by a male divinity, NANNA (like\nINANNA but minus the initial 'I'), and was considered the Father of the Gods by the\nearliest Sumerian religion. It should be noted, however, that all of the planetary deities,\ntermed \"the zoned Ones\" or zonei in Greek, and indeed all of the Sumerian deities, had\nboth male and female manifestations, showing that the Sumerians definitely recognised a\nyin-yang composition if the universe (the \"male Moon\" idea is, the Editor is given to\nunderstand, common to so-called Aryan mythologies). There is also evidence to show\nthat every god and goddess also had both a good and an evil nature, and evil gods were\nbanished in the exorcism formulae of that civilisation as well as the lesser forms of\ndemon.\nThe Horned Moon\nAs mentioned, the God of the Moon was called NANNA by the Sumerians.

Eventually, Satanism, Protestantism and\nJudaism were inextricably woven together to form a patchwork quilt of Evil that the\nChurch attempted to destroy during the Middle Ages, with fire and sword.\nAs a matter of fact, a certain type of devil worship did exist during those times but,\nironically, the acolytes of Hell were usually never brought to trial; something which\nstems from the fact that many of those who celebrated and attended the infamous Black\nMasses of the period were Roman Catholic clergymen, many of whom has been pressed\ninto His Service at a young age by their parents, who wished to see their sons brought up\nwell-fed and educated in those uncertain times, where the Church was the sole power and\nrefuge. The frustration at being \"condemned\" to a life that demanded the abandonment of\nsociety and a \"normal\" life led many priests to express their hostilities through the Office\nof the Demon, the Black Mass. Often, this was also a means of political demonstration, as\nthe Church controlled virtually all the political life of the period. In a way, as though in a\ntest tube at a philosophical laboratory, Aleister Crowley was brought up under similar\ncircumstances - although ver far removed in time from the days of the Church's immense\ntemporal power. Coming from a fanatically religious Christian family, and suddenly\nfreed upon the neighbourhood of Cambridge, Crowley did, in a sense, turn Satanist. He\nidentified strongly with the underdog, politically as well as spiritually, and came\neventually to take the Name of the Beast as his own, and expound a philosophy that he\nhoped would rip apart the worn tapestry of the established moral Christian atmosphere of\nVictorian England, and expose it for what it really was, a carpet made of many ingenious\nthreads and not God - or eternal happiness - at all; only nap.\nTherefore, it seemed almost logical that he should seek in the defeated, Old Religions of\nthe world for the basis of his new philosophy and, some say, his new \"religion\". He\nraised the female aspect back up to one of equality with the male, as it was in the rites of\nEgypt, and of Eleusis. \"Our Lady Babalon\" (his spelling) became a theme of many of his\nmagickal writings, and he received he Credo, the Book of the Law, through a Woman, his\nwife Rose Kelly.

Instead, it ends before he can name himself or even one relation. We can only\nimagine with horror what fate befell this noble Sage.\nAnother problem that confronts the Editor is the suspected frequency of the copyist's\nglosses; that is, there do seem to be occasionally bits of sentence or fragments of\nliterature that would seem to be inconsistent with the period in which the text was\nwritten. However, no final word can be said on this matter. The difficulty arises in the"}
{"17": "The etymology is even dramatic where Magick is concerned, and aids us in understand\neven Crowley's system better than we do. As an example, Crowley of (or Aiwass) ends\nthe Book of the Law with the words \"AUM.HA.\" In the Sumero-Aryan Dictionary by\nWaddell we read that the word AUM was known to the Sumerians, in almost the same\nsense that it was, and is, known to the Hindus. It is a sacred word, and pertains to the\nLord of Magicians, ENKI. Further, the Greek spelling of ENKI was EA, by which he is\nmost commonly known in the European texts which treat of Sumeriology. In the Greek\nalphabet, EA would appear as HA. Q.E.D: AUM.HA betrays the essential Sumerian\ncharacter of that Book.\nAfter the initial Testimony, we come to the chapter entitles \"Of the ZONEI and Their\nAttributes\", Zonei is, of course a Greek word and refers to the planetary, or heavenly\nbodies; for they are \"zoned\", i.e., having set courses and spheres. They are also known as\nsuch in the Chaldean Oracles. The 'spirits' or bodies that exist beyond the zonei are called\nthe azonei, meaning \"un-zoned\". Whether this refers to the so-called \"fixed \" stars\n(having no sphere ascertainable to the early astronomers) or the comets, is unknown to\nthe Editor. Whatever the case may be, the zonei seem to include the Seven Philosophical\nPlanets, i.e., including the Sun and Moon as planetary bodies, along with Mercury,\nVenus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Each has their own seal and their own Number.\nKenneth Grant, author of Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God, may be interested to\nknow (or may already know) that the Number of the Sumerian Goddess of Venus, hence\nof Love and War, is Fifteen. In many of the ancient tablets of that period, she is actually\nreferred to as \"the Fifteen\", as a shortcut to spelling out the whole Name in cuneiform,\nwas assume. Grant made much of \"the Goddess Fifteen\" in his study of Crowley's system\nas related to Tantricism, without mentioning the Name by which this Goddess is quite\nwell-known, or even mentioning Her native country!\nAfter the chapter on Zonei, we come to the \"Book of Entrance\" which is really a system\nof self-initiation into the planetary spheres and may have something to do with the\nplanetary arrangement of the steps of the ziggurats of Mesopotamia, which were seven\nstoreyed mountains. Not much is revealed to the potential candidate for initiation as to\nhow these \"gates\" work, or what he might find there, save to say that the key of one Gate"}
{"18": "viewed it as a 'barbarous' tongue' which must be preserved because of its essential Power.\nIndeed, with the publication of this Book, Sumerian may become as popular among\nmagicians as the strange, angelic language of Enochian, discovered by Dr. Dee in\nElizabeth England.\nIn Greek, in the original MS., a common incantation would look something like this\n(using Roman characters for the Greek):\n'O Kakos Theos\n'O Kakos Daimon\n'O Daimon\nPNEUMA TOU OURANOU THUMETHERE!\nPNEUMA TES GES THUMETHATE!\n(O Wicked God\nO Wicked Demon\nO Demon\nSpirit of the Sky, Remember!\nSpirit of the Earth, Remember!)\nYet, a word like SHAMMASH, the Name of the Solar Deity, would read SAMAS or\nSAMMAS, and in the text of the NECRONOMICON we would make the word read like\nits original.\nThe \"Conjuration of the Watcher\" follows the Fire God conjuration. The word \"watcher\"\nis sometimes used synonymously with \"angel\", and sometimes as a distinct Race, apart\nfrom angelos: egragori. The Race of Watchers are said not to care what they Watch, save\nthat they follow orders. They are somewhat mindless creatures, but quite effective.\nPerhaps they correspond toe Lovecraft's shuggoths, save that the latter become unweildly\nand difficult to manage.\nAfter the Watcher, comes the MAKLU text, which appears to be a collection of"}
{"19": "Then appears the Centrepiece of the Book, the MAGAN text. The word MAGAN may\nmean the Land of the MAGAN which was said to lie in the West of Sumer. For a time, it\nseems the name MAGAN was synonymous with the Place of Death - as the Sun 'died' in\nthe West. Hence, it is a bit confusing as to what MAGAN is really supposed to mean in\nthis text, but in context the \"Place of Death\" explanation seems quite valid. The MAGAN\ntext is nothing more than an incomplete and free-form version of the Creation Epic of\nSumer, along with INANNA's Descent into the Underworld, and many glosses. We are\ntold how MARDUK slays TIAMAT - after much the same fashion that the Chief of\nPolice of Amity slays the great white shark in Benchley's novel JAWS, blowing an evil\nwind (the oxygen tank) into Her mouth and sending in an arrow (bullet) in after it to\nexplode her. Surely, the two or three most box-office successful films of the past few\nyears, JAWS, THE EXORICST and, perhaps, THE GODFATHER, are an indication that\nthe essence of Sumerian mythology is making itself felt in a very real way in this, the\nlatter half of the Twentieth Century?\nAfter the long and poetic MAGAN text, comes the URILLIA text which might be\nLovecraft's R'lyeh Text, and is subtitled \"Abominations\". It has more specifically to do\nwith the worship of the Serpent, and the nature of the cults that participate in the\nConcelebration of Sin. Again, more conjurations and seals are given, even though the\nreader is charged not to use them; an inconsistency that is to be found in many grimoires\nof any period and perhaps reveals a little of the magicians's mentality; for there is very\nlittle that is evil to the advanced magus, who cares not if he deals with angelic or demonic\nforces, save that he gets the job done!\nThen, following the URILLIA text and forming the very end of the received MS., is the\nSecond Part of the Testimony of the Mad Arab. It is a haunting and sorrowful occult\npersonality. Was he really mad? This is perhaps a question that will go on for as long as\nMan tries to understand himself; himself as a part of the cosmic dance and spiral, which\nincludes the satanic as well as the deific, the sad as well as the happy. Perhaps the Arab\nwas privy to some other-worldly secret that he could not reveal. Perhaps he had opened\nthe Door by mistake, his own personal Gate to the Abyss, and was forced to cross its\nthreshold into the Unknown. We may never know."}

However, there are a few sounds which English does not\npossess, and which have been put into phonetic variations. Important examples below :\nX\nas in the German \"ach\"\nCH\n(same as above)\nQ\nas in \"like\"\nK\n(same as above)\nSH\nas in \"shall\"\nSS\nas in, perhaps, \"lasso\"; a hissing \"s\" common to Arabic languages\nZ\nas in \"lots\"; a hard \"ts\" sound, not quite as in \"zoo\"\nRemember, in the transliterations which follow, every letter must be pronounced. There\nare no schwas or silent syllables in Sumerian. Hence, \"KIA\" is pronounced \"keeya\";\n\"KAIMANU\" is pronounced \"ka-ee-mah-nu\" or, if spoken rapidly, the two initial vowel\nsounds slur into 'kigh' rhyming with \"high\"\nThe incantations should be said carefully and slowly at first, to familiarise oneself with\nthe tongue-twisting phrases.

{"28": "Western occult history. the deities and demons identified within have probably not been\neffectively summoned in nearly six thousand years. Ordinary exorcisms and banishing\nformulae have thus far proved extremely inadequate: this, by experienced magicians.\nHence, the following recommendations.\nThe religion of the ancient Sumerian peoples seems to have been lunar-oriented, a\nreligion - or religion - magickal structure - of the night, of darkness in a sense.\nInvocations using solar formulae have proved thus far effective in successfully banishing\nNECRONOMICON demons and intelligences. For instance, the Kaddish prayer of the\nJewish faith contains some solar elements that have proved resilient to inimical genii, and\nthe vibration of the Lord's Prayer for Christians is also a workable method.\nWe suggest that individual operators utilise an equivalent solar (i.e., positive light)\ninvocation from their own religion or the religion of their ancestors, should the no longer\nhave a religion or should they have changed it in their lifetime.\nFor best practical purposes in the beginning - for those intent on actually using the rituals\ncontained herein - it is advisable to take especial care in the construction of the magickal\ncircle and of all magickal defences. A preliminary period of purification is well in order\nbefore attempting anything in this grimoire. Persons of unstable mental condition, or\nunstable emotional condition, should not be allowed, under any circumstances, to observe\none of these rituals in progress. That would be criminal, and perhaps in suicidal. One of\nour colleagues was fearfully attacked by his dog directly following a fairly simple and\nuncomplicated formula from this book. This is definitely not a Gilbert chemistry set.\nThe method of the NECRONOMICON concerns deep, primeval forces that seem to pre-\nexist the normal archetypal images of the tarot trumps and the Golden Dawn telesmatic\nfigures. These are forces that developed outside the Judeo-Christian mainstream, and\nwere worshipped and summoned long before the creation of the Qabala as we know it\ntoday. Hence, the ineffectiveness of the Golden Dawn banishing procedures against them.\nThey are not necessarily demonic or qliphotic in the sense that these terms are commonly\nunderstood in the West, they just simply represent power sources largely untapped and\nthus far ignored by twentieth-century, mainstream consciousness."}

This serpent was surely larger than any I had ever seen. The thinnest\nsection thereof was fully that of the arms of two men, and as it rose from the earth it was\nfollowed by another, although the end of the first was not seen as it seemed to reach\ndown into the very Pit itself.

NANNA, Father of the Gods, Remember!\nWherefore, the amulet must be engraved upon pure silver in the full light of the moon,\nthat the moon shine upon it at its working, and the essence of the moon incantations must\nbe performed, and the prescribed rituals as given forth in this Book. And the amulet must\nnever be exposed to the light of the Sun, for SHAMMASH called UDU, in his jealousy,\nwill rob the seal of its power. In such a case, it must be bathed in water of camphor, and\nthe incantations and ritual performed once again.

And it\nwas a painful and lonely journey, during which time I took no wife, called no house or\nvillage my home, and dwelt in various countries, often in caves or in the deserts, learning\nseveral tongues as a traveller might learn them, to bargain with the tradespeople and learn\nof their news and customs. But my bargaining was with the Powers that reside in each of\nthese countries. And soon, I cam to understand many things which before I had no"}

I learned of the powers of the\nastral Gods, and how to summon their aid in times of need. I learned, too, of the frightful\nbeings who dwell beyond the astral spirits, who guard the entrance to the Temple of the\nLost, of the Ancient of Days, the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, whose Name I cannot\nwrite here.\nIn my solitary ceremonies in the hills, worshipping with fire and sword, with water and\ndagger, and with the assistance of a strange grass that grows wild in certain parts of\nMASSHU, and with which I had unwittingly built my fire before the rock, that grass that\ngives the mind great power to travel tremendous distances into the heavens, as also into\nthe hells, I received the formulae for the amulets and talismans which follow, which\nprovide the Priest with safe passage among the spheres wherein he may travel in search\nof the Wisdom.\nBut now, after One Thousand-and-One moons of the journey, the Maskim nip at my\nheels, the Rabishu pull at my hair, Lammashta opens her dread jaws, AZAG-THOTH\ngloats blindly at his throne, KUTULU raises his head and stares up through the Veils of\nsunkun Varloorni, up through the Abyss, and fixes his stare upon me; wherefore I must\nwith haste write this indeed, it appears as though I have failed in some regard as to the\norder of the rites, or to the formulae, or to the sacrifices, for now it appears as if the entire\nhost of ERESHKIGAL lies waiting, dreaming, drooling for my departure. I pray the Gods\nthat I am saved, and not perish as did the Priest, ABDUL BEN-MARTU, in Jerusalem\n(the Gods remember and have mercy upon him!). My fate is no longer writ in the stars,\nfor I have broken the Chaldean Covenant by seeking power over the Zonei. I have set\nfoot on the moon, and the moon no longer has power over me. The lines of my life have\nbeen oblitered by my wanderings in the Waste, over the letters writ in the heavens by the\ngods. And even now I can hear the wolves howling in the mountains as they did that\nfateful night, and they are calling my name, and the names of Others.

And in these things the worshippers of the Dog will rejoice, and\nreap the spoils of these conflicts, and will grow fat.\nIf thou happenest upon such a Cult in the midst of their Rituals, do but hide well so that\nthey do not see thee, else they will surely kill thee and make of thee a sacrifice to their\nGods, and thy spirit will be in grave danger, and the howling of the wolves will be for\nthee and the spirit which escapes from thee. This, if thou be lucky to die quickly, for\nthese Cults rejoice in the slow spilling of blood, whereby they derive much power and\nstrength in their Ceremonies."}
{"145": "rebellious demons who would destroy the civilisations of man.\nAnd if thou knowest the names of they who would harm thee, write them upon figures of\nwax, made in their image, upon which you will make the Curse and melt them in the\ncauldron you have set up within the MANDAL of protection. And the Watcher will carry\nthe Curse to them for whom it was uttered. And they will die.\nAnd if thou does not know of their names, nor of their persons, save that they seek to\nharm thee, make a doll of wax like a man, with his limbs, but with no face. And upon the\nface of the doll write the word KASHSHAPTI. Hold the doll over the flaming cauldron\nwhile saying fiercely over it:\nATTI MANNU KASHSHAPTU SHA TUYUB TA ENNI!\nand then drop the doll into the flame. From the smoke that rises from this action, you will\nsee the name of the sorcerer or sorceress written within it. And then you will be able to\nsend the Watcher to bring the Curse. And that person will die.\nOr thou mayest call upon ISHTAR to protect thee from the spells of sorcery. And for this,\nthe MANDAL must be prepared as always, and a figure of ISHTAR be upon the altar,\nand incantations made to summon Her assistance, like the following incantation that is\nancient, from the Priests of UR:\nWHO ART THOU, O WITCH, THAT SEEKEST ME?\nThou hast taken the road\nThou hast come after me\nThou hast sought me continually for my destruction\nThou hast continually plotted an evil thing against me\nThou hast encompassed me\nThou hast sought me out\nThou hast gone forth and followed my steps\nBut I, by the command of the Queen ISHTAR"}
{"146": "I unclothe thy wickedness and evil\nAnd bring your sorceries to naught!\nIt is not I, but NANAKANISURRA\nMistress of Witches\nAnd the Queen of heaven ISHTAR\nWho command thee!\nAnd if these worshippers and sorcerers still come at thee, as it is possible, for their power\ncomes from the Stars, and who knows the ways of the Stars?, thou must call upon the\nQueen of Mysteries, NINDINUGGA, who wilt surely save thee. And thou must make\nincantations with her Title, which is NINDINUGGA NIMSHIMSHARGAL\nENLILLARA. And it is enough merely to shout that Name aloud, Seven times, and she\nwill come to thine aid.\nAnd remember that thou purify thy temple with the branches of cypress and of pine, and\nno evil spirit which haunteth buildings will cause habitation to be set up therein, and no\nlarvae will breed, as they do in many unclean places. The larvae are enormous, twice as\nlarge as a man, but do breed on his excretions, and even, it s said, upon his breath, and\ngrow to terrible height, and do not leave him until the Priest or some magician cut him off\nwith the copper dagger, saying the name of ISHTAR seven times seven times, aloud, in a\nsharp voice.\nThe night has now grown silent. The howling of the wolves has grown quiet, and can\nscarce be heard. Perhaps it was some other that they sought? Yet, can I tell in my bones\nthat this is not so? For the XASTUR sign has not left its station behind me, and has\ngrown larger, casting a shadow over these pages as I write. I have summoned my\nWatcher, but It is troubled by some Things and does not respond to me well, as though\nafflicted with some disease, and dazed.\nMy books have lost light, and settle upon their shelves like animals fallen asleep, or dead.\nI am sickened by what voices I hear now, as though the voices of my family, left behind\nme so many years ago, that is impossible to conceive that they are about. Did I not\nunderstand of their untimely, unnatural death? Can the demons who wait Without take on"}
{"147": "strange to our minds, for are they not the Computors of All Time? Did they not set Time\nin its Place?

By their wounds shall ye know\nthem, and by their smell, for they are not born as men, but in some other fashion; by\nsome corruption of seed or spirit that has given them other properties than those we are\nfamiliar with.
